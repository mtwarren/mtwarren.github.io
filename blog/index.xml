      <description>Specific Ion Effects on Type III Microemulsions Specific ion effects have been a topic of immense interest and a solution sought after by multiple fields. Most of the current understanding has been developed with the help physical chemistry and new analytical methods. While other researchers in fields such as colloids have contributed, many questions remain.23 The importance of understanding ionic interactions that contribute to macromolecular properties can be seen directly today in advancements in proteomics and in respect to Dr.</description>
