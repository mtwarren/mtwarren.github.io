<h2 id="specific-ion-effects">Specific Ion Effects</h2>

<p>Specific ion effects have been a topic of immense interest and a solution sought after by multiple fields. Most of the current understanding has been developed with the help physical chemistry and new analytical methods.
While other researchers in fields such as colloids have contributed, many questions remain.23  The importance of understanding ionic interactions
that contribute to macromolecular properties can be seen directly today in advancements in proteomics and in respect to Dr. Franz Hofmeister,
who is considered the father of specific ion effects, a quick review of specific ion effects will begin with his valuable contributions.24,25</p>

<p>In the current literature, specific ion effects or specific ion phenomena are typically described based on the molecular environment
(ion-solvent, ion-protein, ion-surfactant, etc.). Often researchers will attempt to correlate experimental data to the physical parameters,
usually fail to do so, and compare to the Hofmeister series.26 The Hofmeister series, developed through the observation of the salting effects
occurring with egg white proteins, is an empirical series that accounts for anion and cations ability to precipitate proteins.24,25</p>

<p>The original Hofmeister series as observe is shown in Figure 4. It was realized that certain ions had the tendency to withdraw water from the
protein and vary the hydrophobic effects occurring within the system. Hofmeister ranked the ions based on the observed extent which gave rise
to the definitions of ‘chaotropes’ and ‘kosmotropes’, both meaning “disorder maker” and “order-maker” respectively.24-27 These terms are commonly
found in the literature; however, one must be careful when using these terms to “predict” behaviors. Both refer to their abilities to manipulate
the water structure surrounding the respective ions and is used to describe the solvation and does not account for other properties observed.26,27
It has been found and not a surprise that the original series is unable to predict the ion effects within certain systems.26,27
Now it can be said to be redundant and only applicable to the situation the series is ranked. This is due to many instances of salt series deviating
from Hofmeister as well as researchers considering that the ions were assumed as an isolated species in solution.27 Today, most consider the ion series
rather than salt series and attempts to create models accounting for ionic behavior using physical parameters continue.
Luckily, the inabilities of the first significant models have enlightened the path forward.<br />
The first ‘successful’ model was the Debye-Huckel equations that worked for low concentrations of ions. The equation is shown [9] and was innovative
by taking a fundamental electromagnetic law, in Coulomb’s law, and including the idea of the Debye length.29 The Debye length, 1/k, approximates an
ideal ionic radius that can be calculated out of the Debye-Huckel equation.</p>

<p>One very famous theory considered two main forces: the Coulombic forces and Van der Waal forces (VdW). It was then further assumed there would be a
potential between two likely charged ions that were placed next to each other, in which the forces overlap.26-27 This theory is named after the authors
and is termed, DLVO. The theory itself is derived through observations of the strong short range VdW forces and acknowledges the coulombic force that brings
about stability within colloidal aggregates.27, 30 It has been very impactful to the field especially in conditions with low ion concentrations.
However, the problem with DVLO is that is neglects the dynamic polarizability that occurs within solution as well as specific ion hydration that the
short range VdW forces depend on, primarily due to the assumption of ion’s being point-like particles.<br />
Another major conceptual model considered the ion-ion preferences while addressing Hofmeister’s observations.   Developed by Collins, the Law of
Matching Water Affinities (LMWA) was conceived through assuming the ion’s charge density as a physical parameter as well as assumes the resulting
ion–ion interactions are due to the ions affinity within water.30 In other words, it simply says that if the ions have similar charge density and match
affinities to another ion, both ions will interact as a pair. The model when tested against different ionic series in solution shows close agreement
to experimental activity coefficients relating to ion-ion interactions towards similar ion densities.32 It also provides evidence for why large chaotropic
ions such as I − or Cs + do not interact ideally with small kosmotropic ions.30</p>
