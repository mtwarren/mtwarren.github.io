##  Specific Ion Effects on Type III Microemulsions



Specific ion effects have been a topic of immense interest and a solution sought after by multiple fields. Most of the current understanding has been developed with the help physical chemistry and new analytical methods. 
While other researchers in fields such as colloids have contributed, many questions remain.23  The importance of understanding ionic interactions 
that contribute to macromolecular properties can be seen directly today in advancements in proteomics and in respect to Dr. Franz Hofmeister,
who is considered the father of specific ion effects.
	
Below is the poster presented at the 2018 SIS- 22nd International Symposium on Surfactants in Solution at the University of Oklahoma on current research.
